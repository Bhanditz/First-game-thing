# First-game-thing
I am new to programming so im going to start small. I am going to try to create a graphicless 
game that asks a user to input a name then they have 2 options 'Hit' or 'Block' and then depending on what 
they choose i will put it into a random number generator to decide if they sucsesfuly blocked or hit
my goal is to just complete the program and try to learn new ways of doing things
